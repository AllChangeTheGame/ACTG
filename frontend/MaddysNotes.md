Homepage:
Tidy up visuals
Change 'update' button to an 'add' and a 'deduct' button for the money tracker
Add drop downs for money additions/deductions (purchase ticket, buy screw you card etc) as well as a free text reason 
Pop up for adjusting money also includes reminders for multipliers for FR and GE and multiple challenge cards- maybe a calculator?

Menu:
Order it so it goes 
Shop
Reference
Log Out
Underneath 'Reference' Should be a further list containing transaction history, tools, guides, delay calculator,


'claiming' a route doesn't yet actually claim it or change the distances
Money tracker needs to link to an actual API, it needs to update automatically from certain actions
